        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p> My name is William "Liam" Dowden IV. I study applied mathematics at the <a href= "https://www.uri.edu/" target="_blank"> University of Rhode Island </a>. 
            I am from North Kingstown, Rhode Island. I have lived in Rhode Island my whole life. In my free time I enjoy playing video games, playing golf, and hanging
        out with my friends. I am interested in computer science because I think coding would be a valuable skill to learn for my future. </p>
